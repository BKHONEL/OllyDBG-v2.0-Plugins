Copy OllyPEiD.dll into the Plugins directory. Note: the userdb.txt must be in
the same directory as the plugin unless otherwise specified in ollydbg.ini.

Keep in mind this is an alpha release. I have not fully tested and taken the
time to remove all possibility for bugs so there may be a few lingering around.
